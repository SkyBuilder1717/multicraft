MultiCraft Game mod: carts
==========================
Based on (and fully compatible with) the mod "carts" by PilzAdam
and the one contained in the subgame "minetest_game".
Target: Run smoothly as possible, even on laggy servers.

 Features
----------
- A fast cart for your railway or roller coaster
- Easily configurable cart speed using the Advanced Settings
- Boost and brake rails
- By mesecons controlled Start-Stop rails
- Detector rails that send a mesecons signal when the cart drives over them
- Rail junction switching with the 'right/left' walking keys
- Handbrake with the 'back' key
- Support for non-minetest_game subgames


Carts, based almost entirely on the mod boost_cart [1], which
itself is based on (and fully compatible with) the carts mod [2].

The model was originally designed by stujones11 [3] (CC-0).

Rails textures are based on original work from PixelBOX by Gambit (permissive
license).

Cart model changed specifically for MultiCraft (LGPLv3+).
The Cart texture drawn specifically for MultiCraft (CC-BY-SA 4.0).
